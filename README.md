# Paycheck Calculator
Created a simple calculator that calculates a weekly paycheck at $12 an hour. Also calculates any overtime an employee works.
Program can be easily modified to change the wage, or even have user input for the hourly wage.

Overtime Pay = Time and a half.
Taxes = 15% of the first $300
        20% of the next $150
        25% of the rest of the paycheck.
        
Program shows gross pay, taxes withdrawn, and net pay.
